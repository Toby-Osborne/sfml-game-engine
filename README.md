# C++ Game Engine

## Overview

I was bored one day, then I had an idea for a game. I thought a good idea might be to try and create it from
scratch, so that's what I'm doing.  I have subsequently determined that I am not very good at gamedev.

## Current Work

Some kind of tilebased game with infinite random maps.  file extension stands for not-in-game.  Probably should implement some kind of actual entity system and fix the map renderer at some point.

## Features

 - SFML?  I guess?
 - Modern™ C++™ (smart pointers everywhere)
