# C++ Game Engine

## Overview

I was bored one day, then I had an idea for a game. I thought a good idea might be to try and create it from
scratch, so that's what I'm doing.

## Idea behind the game

Terraria but rotated by 90 degrees. There's a lot more too it than that. Check out the trello board for more
information.

## Features

### To be implemented

- TileSet
- Collision Detection
- World Generation
- Inventory/Crafting (from editable files)
- Creatures/Entities with AI

### Implemented already

- Chunk Handler/Loader class (drawable)
- Map class with save and load
- Basic player class
