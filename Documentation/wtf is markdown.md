## Biomes
### Flesh
- Large creature stuck in the wall.
- Canonically crawled in and got stuck
- After mining into it, the flesh regrows.
- Depending on how you kill the boss, the biome evolves into a different one.
  - Poisoned -> Rotting Carcass (ala Core Keeper's Larva Hive?)
  - Irradiated -> Cancerous Corpse (ala The End Is Nigh?)
  - 
### The Nests
- Rocky
- Lots of small indents into the wall for bird nests
- Large nest/cavern to house the biome boss, the mama bird
- Trying to bypass the biome spawns flocks to attack the player
