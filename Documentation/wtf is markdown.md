|     |     | Slower than conventional Fast Travel    |
|     |     |     |
## Biomes
### Flesh
- Large creature stuck in the wall.
- Canonically crawled in and got stuck
- After mining into it, the flesh regrows.
- Depending on how you kill the boss, the biome evolves into a different one.
  - Poisoned -> Rotting Carcass (ala Core Keeper's Larva Hive?)
  - Irradiated -> Cancerous Corpse (ala The End Is Nigh?)

### Flesh-Garden Bridge
 
- Capillaries
- Worms into snakes
- Overgrown areas on both sides of the garden

### Garden Biome

- Plants vs Zombies style plants that eat you
- Overgrown area on either side of the garden
- Walls will be mossy and have vines
- Some kind of flame thrower or calcification to solidify vines into something you can stand on
- Can also freeze the vines for ice


### The Nests
- Rocky
- Lots of small indents into the wall for bird nests
- Large nest/cavern to house the biome boss, the mama bird
- Trying to bypass the biome spawns flocks to attack the play

### Polygon

- As you approach boss, resolution of textures and color decreases.  When you kill the boss 
- WHen you jump from a higher level down, your screen reduces in pixels count
- Use postprocessing to do downscaling, just before the boss switch to different tileset.

### Earthworm Biome

- Network of caves very thin, like capillaries

### Final Layer

- Final boss requries wings to fight, uses open air above the wall to battle
- Atlas holding another copy of the world up. 
- One of the middle levels so people think they got to the end
- 

## Mechanics

- Gated vertical travel.  Ladders -> Grappling Hook -> Air Travel via vertical column -> fast air travel with glider -> 
  wings?
- Unlock air travel initially by crafting armor from flesh carapace that lets you travel 
- Beat the final boss and unlock going downwards
- **Start in the middle of the wall**
- Fishing at the bottom of the wall?

### Reusing Biomes

- Subbiome further into the wall gated by difficulty
- Noita style, cursed rock but if you get through the cursed rock there is a copy of the original game on the other 
  side with slight variations.  Parallel worlds on either side.  Maybe use this idea?
- 

### Vertical Cum Craving Vermin

- Rats in a layer obsessed with white liquid
- Rubber Room with rats

### Barrier at the bottom of the wall

- Get tungsten cube at the top of the wall
- only dropping this cube has enough pressure to unlock digging down
- alternative, the world is the monster and drop cube to kill it
